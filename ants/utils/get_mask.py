def get_mask(image, low_thresh=None, high_thresh=None, cleanup=2):
    """
    Get a binary mask image from the given image after thresholding

    ANTsR function: `getMask`

    Arguments
    ---------
    image : ANTsImage
        image from which mask will be computed. Can be an antsImage of 2, 3 or 4 dimensions.
    
    low_thresh : scalar (optional)   
        An inclusive lower threshold for voxels to be included in the mask.
        If not given, defaults to image mean.
    
    high_thresh : scalar (optional) 
        An inclusive upper threshold for voxels to be included in the mask.
        If not given, defaults to image max
    
    cleanup : integer
        If > 0, morphological operations will be applied to clean up the mask by eroding away small or weakly-connected areas, and closing holes.
        If cleanup is >0, the following steps are applied
            1. Erosion with radius 2 voxels
            2. Retain largest component
            3. Dilation with radius 1 voxel
            4. Morphological closing
    
    Returns

    ANTsImage
    
    Example
    -------
    >>> image = ants.image_read( ants.get_ants_data('r16') )
    >>> mask = ants.get_mask(image)
